- Future agentic decision-making

---

# ⚙️ Backend API

The backend is implemented using **FastAPI**.

Main application:

```text
backend/app.py
```

The API exposes a health endpoint and query endpoints.

### Health Check

```http
GET /
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "message": "Enterprise GPT Backend is active"
}
```

### Query Endpoint

```http
POST /api/query
```

An equivalent route is also available:

```http
POST /query
```

Request:

```json
{
  "query": "What is the employee leave policy?",
  "designation": "HR Operations Lead"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "answer": "Generated enterprise-grounded answer...",
  "citations": []
}
```

The `designation` field is optional and currently has a default value configured by the backend.

---

# 🚨 API Validation

The backend validates incoming requests.

For example, an empty query is rejected:

```http
400 Bad Request
```

Example:

```json
{
  "detail": "Query cannot be empty."
}
```

Pipeline failures are returned as server errors rather than silently returning an invalid response.

---

# 🔐 Environment Variables

API credentials should be provided through environment variables rather than hard-coded in source code.

Example:

```text
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Depending on the configured environment, the backend can also recognize:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Important

Never commit real API keys, passwords, tokens, or other secrets to GitHub.

Use environment-specific configuration for development and production.

---

# 🚀 Running the Backend Locally

Navigate to the backend directory:

```powershell
cd backend
```

Create a virtual environment:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it on Windows:

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure the required environment variables.

Run the application:

```powershell
python app.py
```

The API will run using the configured port, with `8000` used by default when no deployment `PORT` is supplied.

---

# 💻 Running the Frontend Locally

Navigate to the frontend:

```powershell
cd Frontend
```

Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
